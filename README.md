# SimpleProjects
Simple projects I've made for learning purpose. <br />
I saw these projects on internet and write them: <br />
Kilo Editor: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/ <br />
ASCII art, game of life, photomosaics: https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/ <br />
For ascii art and photomosaics I've used stb_image library from http://github.com/nothings/stb <br />
Any other library can be used for reading and writing images.
